This is a basic CVS howto (actually not really one) only to explain how to
use this repository.

We have a working directory called 'plt_project' in /home/sc2516/Projects/. This 
document is only to explain how to use it (for checking it out , checking in updated code,
updating files , adding new files and directories and to delete files and directories from it.
A more detailed instruction is available in the cvs manpages or on internet sites

Checking out the repository

These commands are specific to bash shell. May be a bit different for other shells . Eg. for tcsh you may need to replace 'export' 
with 'set env'

1. $ cd <directory where you want to download>
2. $ export CVS_RSH=ssh
3. $ cvs -d <your cs id>@compute01.cs.columbia.edu:/home/sc2516/Projects/ checkout plt_project

 This will authenticate you through ssh. It will present to you a ssh prompt where you need to input
 your cs password. 

Checking in your updates

1. $ cd plt_project
2. $ export CVS_RSH=ssh
3. $ cvs -d <your cs id>@compute01.cs.columbia.edu:/home/sc2516/Projects/ up .
 (This will only sync your copy of the directory to the one in the repository. To finall
  upload your copy to the repository you will need to type the final command which is next
 )
4. $ cd ../
5. $ cd -d <your cs id>@compute01.cs.columbia.edu:/home/sc2516/Projects commit plt_project

Adding new files in your copy of the directory to the one in the repository

1. $ cd plt_project
2. $ export CVS_RSH=ssh
3. $ cvs -d <your cs id>@compute01.cs.columbia.edu:/home/sc2516/Projects add <new file name>
      
As usual ssh authentication will follow

4. $ cvs -d <your cs id>@compute01.cs.columbia.edu:/home/sc2516/Projects/ up .

5. Finally 'commit' the new file to the repository

7. $ cd ../
8. $ cvs -d <your cs id>@compute01.cs.columbia.edu:/home/sc2516/Projects commit plt_project

Adding a new directory to the repository
(assumes you have already done 'export CVS_RSH=ssh')

1. $ cd plt_project
2. $ mkdir new_dir
3. $ touch new_dir/new_file /* add a new file to the new directory */
4. $ cvs -d <your cs id>@compute01.cs.columbia.edu:/home/sc2516/Projects add new_dir
5. $ cvs -d <your cs id>@compute01.cs.columbia.edu:/home/sc2516/Projects add new_dir/new_file
6. $ cvs -d <your cs id>@compute01.cs.columbia.edu:/home/sc2516/Projects/ up .
 
7. $ cd ..  
8. $ cvs -d <your cs id>@compute01.cs.columbia.edu:/home/sc2516/Projects/ commit plt_project

Deleting a file/directory
(EXECUTE THIS WIH UTMOST CAUTION!)

1. $ export CVS_RSH=ssh
2. $ cd plt_project
3. Now assuming you have directory 'old_dir' and with file 'old_file' inside. To delete the file and the 
   directory from the repository type the following commands

4. $ rm old_dir/old_file /*NOTE : if you want to delete more files from the directory old_dir you may do so by
                                  doing a 'rm' on all of them one by one. DO NOT do a 'rm -rf old_dir/*' there
                                  is CVS directory inside the old_dir directory and it must not be deleted. */
5.  DO NOT delete the empty 'old_dir'
6. $ cvs  -d <your cs id>@compute01.cs.columbia.edu:/home/sc2516/Projects/ remove old_dir/old_file  /* for all the file(s) inside 
                             									      old_dir directory */
7. $ cvs -d <your cs id>@compute01.cs.columbia.edu:/home/sc2516/Projects/ release old_dir 
8. $ cvs -d <you cs id>@compute01.cs.columbia.edu:/home/sc2516/Projects/ remove old_dir /* this removes it from the repository but 
											    future 'checkouts' may show it. 
9. 'commit' this updated directory
10. $ cd ../
11. $ cvs -d <your cs id>@compute01.cs.columbia.edu:/home/sc2516/Projects/ commit plt_project
12. Future checkout for avoiding the removed directory from showing up.
13. $cvs -d <your cs id>@compute01.cs.columbia.edu:/home/sc2516/Projects/ checkout -p plt_project
