ABSTRACT="This document specifies a method by which an IP datagram may
be encapsulated (carried as payload) within an IP datagram.
Encapsulation is suggested as a means to alter the normal IP routing for
datagrams, by delivering them to an intermediate destination that would
otherwise not be selected by the (network part of the) IP Destination
Address field in the original IP header. Encapsulation may serve a
variety of purposes, such as delivery of a datagram to a mobile node
using Mobile IP. This RFC is a product of the IP Routing for Wireless/
Mobile Hosts Working Group of the IETF.",

TITLE="Fast Packet Classification for Two-Dimensional Conflict-Free
Filters",
BOOKTITLE=infocom,
DAYS="24--26",
MONTH=apr,
YEAR=2001,
ABSTRACT="Routers can use packet classification to support advanced
functions such as QoS routing, virtual private networks and access
control. Unlike traditional routers, which forward packets based on
destination address only, routers with packet classification capability
can forward packets based on multiple header fields, such as source
address, protocol type, or application port numbers. The
destination-based forwarding can be thought of as {\em
one-dimensional\/} packet classification. While several efficient
solutions are known for the one-dimensional IP lookup problem, the
multi-dimensional packet classification has proved to be far more
difficult. While an $O(\log w)$ time scheme is known for the IP lookup,
Srinivisan et al.~\cite{SurVar99} show a lower bound of $\Omega
(w^{k-1})$ for $k$-dimensional filter lookup, where $w$ is the number of
bits in a header field. In particular, this lower bound precludes the
possibility of a binary search like scheme even for 2-dimensional
filters (say, IP source and destination pairs). In this paper, we
examine this lower bound more closely, and discover that the lower bound
depends crucially on {\em conflicts\/} in the filter database. We then
show that for two-dimensional conflict-free filters, a binary search
scheme does work! Our lookup scheme requires $O(\log^2 w)$ hashes in the
{\em worst-case\/}, and uses $O(n \log^2 w)$ memory. Alternatively, our
algorithm can be viewed as making $O(\log w)$ calls to a prefix lookup
scheme. It has been observed in practice that filter databases have very
few conflicts, and these conflicts can be removed by adding additional
filters (one per conflict). Thus, our scheme may also be quite
practical. Our simulation and experimental results show that the
proposed scheme also performs as good as or better than existing
schemes. For example, on real firewall data-sets with over $200$ rules
consisting of source and destination IP prefixes, our algorithm performs
worst case $12$ hashes. For filter sets containing {\em arbitrarily
many} filtering rules with IP prefixes, the worst case search time
guaranteed is utmost $25$ hashes.",

ABSTRACT="Internet address lookup is a challenging problem because of
increasing routing table sizes, increased traffic, higher speed links,
and the migration to 128 bit IPv6 addresses. IP routing lookup requires
computing the best matching prefix, for which standard solutions like
hashing were believed to be inapplicable. The best existing solution we
know of, BSD radix tries, scales badly as IP moves to 128 bit addresses.
Our paper describes a new algorithm for best matching prefix using
binary search on hash tables organized by prefix lengths. Our scheme
scales very well as address and routing table sizes increase:
independent of the table size, it requires a worst case time of
lg(address bits) hash lookups. Thus only 5 hash lookups are needed for
IPv4 and 7 for IPv6. We also introduce Mutating Binary Search and other
optimizations that, for a typical IPv4 backbone router with over 33,000
entries, considerable reduce the average number of hashes to less than
2, of which one hash can be simplified to an indexed array access. We
expect similar average case behavior for IPv6.",

ABSTRACT="IP address lookup is becoming critical because of increasing
routing table sizes, speed, and traffic in the Internet. Given a set S
of prefixes and an IP address D, the IP address lookup problem is to
find the longest matching prefix of D in set S. This paper shows how
binary search can be adapted for solving the best-matching prefix
problem. Next, we show how to improve the performance of any
best-matching prefix scheme using an initial array indexed by the first
X bits of the address. WE then describe how to take advantage of cache
line size to do a multiway search with six-way branching. Finally, we
show how to extend the binary search solution and the multiway search
solution for Ipv6. For a database of N prefixes with address length W,
naÅ¬ève binary search would take O(W*log N); we show how to reduce this to
O(W+log N) using multiple-column binary search. Measurement using a
practical (Mae - East) database of 38000 entries yield a worst-case
lookup time of 490 ns, five times faster than the Patricia trie scheme
used in BSD UNIX. Our scheme is attractive for Ipv6 because of its small
storage requirement (2N nodes) and speed (estimated worst case of 7
cache line reads per lookup).",

                 implications for the design, control, and analysis of
                 high-speed, cell-based networks. Intuitively, the

                 been shown to apply to wide-area and local-area network
                 traffic. In this paper we examine the mechanisms that
                 give rise to self-similar network traffic. We present
                 an explanation for traffic self-similarity by using a
                 particular subset of wide area traffic: traffic due to
                 the World Wide Web (WWW). Using an extensive set of
                 traces of actual user executions of NCSA Mosaic,
                 reflecting over half a million requests for WWW
                 documents, we show evidence that WWW traffic is
                 self-similar. Then we show that the self-similarity in
                 such traffic can be explained based on the underlying
                 distributions of WWW document sizes, the effects of
                 caching and user preference in file transfer, the
                 effect of user ``think time'', and the superimposition
                 of many such transfers in a local area network. To do
                 this we rely on empirically measured distributions both

BOOKTITLE="Proceedings of USENIX Winter Technical Conference",
ORGANIZATION="Usenix",
PAGES="259--269",
MONTH=jan,
YEAR=1993,
ABSTRACT="Many versions of Unix provide facilities for user-level packet
capture, making possible the use of general purpose workstations for
network monitoring. Because network monitors run as user-level
processes, packets must be copied across the kernel/user-space
protection boundary. This copying can be ninimized by deploying a kernel
agent called a packet filter, which discards unwanted packets as early
as possible. The original Unix packet filter was designed arround a
stack-based filter evaluator that perfomrs sub-optimally on current RISC
CPUs. The BSD Packet Filter (BPF) uses a new, register-based filter
evaluator that is up to 20 times faster than the original design. BPF
also uses a straightforward buffering strategy that makes its overall
performance up to 100 times faster than Sun's NIT running on the same
hardware.",

system that allows local extensions. The SSH protocol consists of three
major com- ponents: Transport layer protocol provides server
authentication, confi- dentiality, and integrity with perfect forward
secrecy. User authentica- tion protocol authenticates the client to the
server. Connection proto- col multiplexes the encrypted tunnel into
several logical channels. Details of these protocols are described in
separate documents.",

ABSTRACT="The SPKI Working Group has developed a standard form for
digital certificates whose main purpose is authorization rather than
authentication. These structures bind either names or explicit
authorizations to keys or other objects. The binding to a key can be
directly to an explicit key, or indirectly through the hash of the key
or a name for it. The name and authorization structures can be used
separately or together. We use S-expressions as the standard format for
these certificates and define a canonical form for those S-expressions.
As part of this development, a mechanism for deriving authorization
decisions from a mixture of certificate types was developed and is
presented in this document. This document gives the theory behind SPKI
certificates and ACLs without going into technical detail about those
structures or their uses.",

  ABSTRACT = {
Active Networks promise greater flexibility than current networks, but
threaten safety and security by virtue of their programmability. In this
paper, we describe the design and implementation of a security architecture
for the active network {\em PLANet}~\cite{HicksMAGN99}.  Security is obtained
with a two-level architecture that combines a functionally restricted packet
language, PLAN~\cite{HicksKMGN98}, with an environment of general-purpose
service routines governed by {\em trust management}.  In
particular, we employ a technique which expands or contracts a packet's
service environment based on its level of privilege, termed {\em
namespace-based security}.  As an application of our security architecture,
we present the design and implementation of an active-network firewall. We
find that the addition of the firewall imposes around a 30\% latency
overhead, and as little as a 6.7\% space overhead to incoming packets.
