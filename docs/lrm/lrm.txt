LANCOM : LRM

Section 1.  
Introduction 

{Will be copied from the White paper}


Section 2.   (Sambuddho)
Overview of LANCOM Syntax:

Whole language is in the form of function blocks . The program begins from 
a main function. From the programmers viewpoint, it is simple a function with name
'main'. The grammar however doesn't support any specific function by the name of 
'main'. It only encloses blocks of code in function scopes. The 'main' is also a
 function. The semantic analysis (actions) must check for that function named 'main'
 for initiating the compilation.
